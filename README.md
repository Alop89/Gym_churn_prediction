# Gym_churn_prediction ðŸ“Š

In the highly competitive world of gyms, keeping customers satisfied and loyal is a critical factor for success. Recognizing this challenge, Model Fitness has embarked on an ambitious initiative: leveraging the power of data analytics to predict and prevent customer churn.

Traditionally, measuring customer churn in a gym relied on simple metrics such as membership cancellations or decreased visit frequency. However, this view is limited. Many customers "fade away" silently, without taking explicit cancellation actions.

Our primary objective is to develop a data-driven customer retention strategy for Model Fitness. Through this project, we aim to provide the company with a valuable tool to analyze customer behavior, optimize marketing efforts, and improve the overall customer experience, leading to increased customer retention and sustainable business growth.
